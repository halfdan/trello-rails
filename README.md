## Contributing

There are several ways you can contribute. Documentation, code, tests, feature requests, bug reports.

I develop trello-rails using [Trello itself](https://trello.com/board/trello-rails/50e8906fbffa35a04e002508).

Pick up an editor, fix a test! (If you want to, of course.) Send a pull
request, and I'll look at it. I only ask a few things:

1. Feature branches please!
2. Adding or refactoring existing features, ensure there are tests.

Also, don't be afraid to send a pull request if your changes aren't done. Just
let me know.
